    <p><strong>Cars</strong> are one of the most significant inventions in human history, transforming the way people live and travel. They provide comfort, independence, and the ability to reach places that were once difficult or time-consuming to access. Over the years, car manufacturers have developed a wide range of vehicles — from compact city cars to powerful SUVs — each designed to meet specific needs and lifestyles. Cars are not just tools for transportation; they’ve also become symbols of innovation, luxury, and personal expression.</p>
