                    <p>Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. They come in a wide
                     variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds. Flowers play a vital
                     role in plant reproduction by producing seeds through pollination. Many flowers are fragrant, which helps
                     attract pollinators and aids in spreading pollen from one flower to another. Beyond their biological purpose,
                     flowers are also admired for their beauty and are used in decorations, ceremonies, and as gifts to express emotions.

                     Different flowers have different symbolic meanings across cultures. For example, roses often represent love,
                     while lilies can symbolize purity and renewal. Some flowers, like the sunflower, follow the sun’s movement
                     across the sky—a behavior known as heliotropism. Others, like the lotus, are admired for their ability to grow
                     beautifully even in muddy waters. In addition to their cultural significance, flowers are also used in producing
                     perfumes, medicines, and even food. Their variety and importance make them a fascinating subject in both science and art.
